# Hypixel-Auction-House-Bot
An open sources auction house suggestion bot.

This bot is designed to cancel out the need for "auction house discord bots", my bot will do this by automating much of the process!

My method of doing so:
- My bot communicates with the API and downloads all of the Auction House data.
- My bot sifts through this data and sorts it into catagorys.
- My bot will then look for items (of a spesific kind or not) and save the item with the highest "profit margin" (diffarence between first cheapest and second cheapest of a said item) to your clip board.
- My bot will then (using a key selected in a config.json file to be added soon) open your minecraft chat (EG: by simulating the keypress T/Enter) and will then paste your clipboard meaning all the user has to do is press enter (and i may potentially automate this in the future).

If you're interested in my bot and plan on sharing it feel free to do so (so long as you're following the rules stated in the MIT Licence agreement).

If you're a developer wanting to get involved with this project feel free to publish a github PR and i will look over your suggested ideas/code!

Thank you alot for showing interest in this software and i hope you enjoy the finished product!
